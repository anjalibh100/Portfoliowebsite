ðŸ‘‰ Gives an overview of table size, number of rows, data space, and index space.

4. Find Current Running Queries
sql
CopyEdit
SELECT spid, cmd, cpu, physical_io, memusage, status, program_name, hostname

    si.rowcnt,
    si.id
FROM sysobjects so
JOIN sysindexes si ON so.id = si.id
WHERE si.indid > 0
AND si.rowcnt = 0
AND so.type = 'U';

FROM master..syslogs
WHERE dbid = db_id('tempdb')
GROUP BY dbid;

ðŸ‘‰ Helps track if tempdb is running out of space.
